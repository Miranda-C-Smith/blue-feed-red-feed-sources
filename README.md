# blue-feed-red-feed-sources
These are the sources for my "Blue Feed, Red Feed" Facebook project.
http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/

This is a subset of data derived from Facebook's study: Bakshy, Eytan; Messing, Solomon; Adamic, Lada, 2015, “Replication Data for: Exposure to Ideologically Diverse News and Opinion on Facebook”, http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LDJ7MS, Harvard Dataverse, V2

We only included sources with `l2` and `r2` scores of .5 and above. We also only included sources with 100,000 or more "likes" (followers) as of the date of publish (May, 18, 2016). We removed some inactive sources, as well as broad ones like Wikipedia, Twitter and YouTube. 

The like counts for this csv were recorded on May 18, 2016.
